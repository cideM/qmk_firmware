# Hanabi Planck

Some small adjustments:
* Swapped left `fn` key with `ctrl` since otherwise hitting `ctrl` is really awkward
* I have two single keys instead of one spacebar and the right one is now `os` (OS) as well. Makes it super easy to open my launcher by hitting both spacebar keys (`space` + `os`)
* `lower` + `raise` together with `hjkl` are left, down, up, right for Neovim style bindings
* `alt` and `os` key swapped on left side so that `alt` is now right next to `lower`
* `alt` is actually `right alt` so that I can type German umlauts easily
